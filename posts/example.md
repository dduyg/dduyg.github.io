I’ve had instructors address a whole class and say, “There’s no such thing as a stupid question.” I now know thaStack Overflow, a  date of the previous month in Python.mportant as the question itself, the asker shows courtesy, which does increase the chance of getting an answer.

```
A: datetime and the datetime.timedelta classes are your friend.

1. find today
2. use that to find the first day of this month.
3. use timedelta to backup a single day, to the last day of the previous month.
4. print the YYYYMM string you're looking for.

Like this:

 >>> import datetime
 >>> today = datetime.date.today()
 >>> first = datetime.date(day=1, month=today.month, year=today.year)
 >>> lastMonth = first - datetime.timedelta(days=1)
 >>> print lastMonth.strftime("%Y%m")
 201202
 >>>

```

In this project, I want to use data to support my observation during my first six months in the U.S, that the milk tea in New York City is much, much, more expensive than it in Beijing. So, I manually scrape 144 drinks from three milk tea shops I mentioned above in Beijing, and scrape 292 drinks from five milk tea shops that I visited in New York. I extract the base drinks, toppings and fruit types of all 436 drinks, as well as their prices.

I never used to think that design and technology went hand in hand.  Thus, learning about software engineering and the role of design has been incredibly interesting to me. Design, implementation, and management are just some of the many things I wish to learn more about. Good art, in a way, makes a person question it. They become joined in the idea of visualization – where captivation meets inspiration.
