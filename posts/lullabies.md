The work revolved around the creation of an interactive platform where users can embark on a cultural exploration through the soothing melodies of lullabies. Our Lullaby Playlist Recommendation Engine will empower the audience to explore and appreciate the diverse range of lullabies from different corners of the globe.

## Objective
Develop a web-based application that recommends lullabies to users based on their preferences and interests. The application leverages the dataset of lullabies from around the world to create curated playlists that introduce users to the rich cultural diversity of children's songs. Users provide preferred mood (calm, soothing, playful), and themes (nature, animals, family). The engine selects lullabies that match the user's preferences, curated from the dataset, with an emphasis on introducing users to lullabies from different cultures and languages. Each lullaby is accompanied by information about its origin country, cultural and emotional context, and translated lyrics. The platform encourages cultural exploration through engaging content.

Harnessing the power of NLP, we analyzed the lyrical content of lullabies. This allowed us to extract themes, sentiments, and cultural references, enhancing the quality of recommendations. The lullaby dataset undergone meticulous preprocessing, including language identification and sentiment analysis. This step lays the foundation for accurate playlist curation. The leveraging our client’s extensive dataset of lullabies from around the world, ensures that user-selected preferences for mood, themes, and language are intelligently matched with lullabies.
