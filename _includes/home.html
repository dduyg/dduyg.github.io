     <p>Retro arcade, where memories fade, In a maze of dreams, where we once played. Pixelated skies, and endless quests, In the heart of the <a class="link" href="#">arcade</a>, we found our rest. In the neon glow of the midnight hour, Lost in the echoes of an old power, Tokens jingling, <a href="#" class="link">joystick</a> in hand, In a world of pixels, where we used to stand.</p>
